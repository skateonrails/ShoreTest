# ShoreTest

This is my repository for Shore GmbH skill test.
I have included some specs (*rspec*) to ruby files, that are in spec folder.

## Instructions

* Questions 1,2 and 3 have specs. You can run the specs using ```bundle exec rspec``` command;
* Question 4 is a .txt file (*question_4.txt*) with the explanation of difference between Java and Ruby method;
* Question 5 is a .sql file (*question_5.sql*) with all the queries needed to answer question 5.

Thanks.
